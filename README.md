I'm a PhD Student in the neurogenomics lab in the UK DRI at Imperial College London. My work focuses on computational biology
and machine learning. See my [personal website](https://al-murphy.github.io/) to learn more about my work and experience.

**Software**:

* [MungeSumstats](https://github.com/neurogenomics/MungeSumstats/) - _Maintainer & Creator_ - Bioconductor R package for the standardisation and quality control of GWAS summary statistics to address the lack of standardisation in the field. MungeSumstats can handle the most common summary statistic formats, including variant call format (VCF) producing a reformatted, standardised, tabular summary statistic file, VCF or R native data object.
* [EWCE](https://github.com/NathanSkene/EWCE) - _Maintainer_ - Expression Weighted Celltype Enrichment (EWCE) is an Bioconductor R package to test the cell type specificity of gene lists using a transcriptomic single-cell reference set.
